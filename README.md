# VITutorial
This repository stores slides for a tutorial on variational inference for NLP audiences. Let us know if you are interested in hosting the tutorial.

# News

* We are now working on mxnet code for variational autoencoders. Soon this will be turned into a jupyter notebook.
* The tutorial has already been presented in Berlin, where it was given in 2 sessions. The focus was on Deep Generative Models ([Module 6](https://github.com/philschulz/VITutorial/blob/master/modules/M6_DeepGenerativeModels/M6_DeepGenerativeModels.pdf)). The next stop will be Dublin.

# Latex Dependencies
To compile the slides, latex needs to have access to the [bayesnet tikz library](https://github.com/jluttine/tikz-bayesnet).

# Python Code

## Dependencies
**Framework**: Our code uses mxnet which is a scalable machine learning library that is under active development.
For more details see [here](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/get_started/install.html).

To run the tutorial code and notebook, we recommend that you setup a virtual environment. Your Python version
should be 3.5 or higher.
**Warning**: If you are using linux and Python3.6 or higher you need to run `sudo apt-get install libssl-dev` before
building Python. Otherwise, there is a chance that your virtualenv will not be able to download packages.
```
virtualenv -p python3.5 vi-tutorial-env
source vi-tutorial-env/bin/activate
pip install mxnet # cpu installation
pip install mxnet-cu80 # gpu installation with cuda 8
pip install jupyter matplotlib
```
**Issues with matplotlib:** If you are using linux and building python from source, pyplot might not work for you 
because it's missing tkinter (`_tkinter` module). In that case run `sudo apt-get install tk-dev` and rebuild python.

## Usage

If you want to use the notebook, run `jupyter notebook` and use your browser to navigate to the notebook file. You can 
then manipulate the notebook and do the exercises in your browser.
