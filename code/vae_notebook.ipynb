    "# How to implement a Variational Autoencoder (VAE)\n",
    "\n",
    "A variational autoencoder observes data, infers a latent code for it and tries to reconstruct the data from that latent code. In contrast to regular autoencoders, the code of the VAE is **random**. That means that when presented with the same input, the VAE will produce a slightly different code each time. This makes its decoding process more robust, since it has to deal with noisy code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way of looking at a VAE is as a training procedure for a probablistic model. The model is \n",
    "$$p(x) = \\int p(z)p(x|z) dz$$\n",
    "where $z$ is the latent code and $x$ is the data. During training we need to infer a posterior over $z$. In the case of a VAE this is done by neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming that the theory of VAEs has already been presented, we now dive straight into implementing them. If you need more background on VAEs, have a look at our [tutorial slides](https://github.com/philschulz/VITutorial/tree/master/modules) and the references therein."

During inference, we use a multivariate Gaussian variational distribution with diagonal covariance matrix. This means that we are only modelling variance but not covariance (in fact, a k-dimensional Guassian with diagonal covariance has the same density as a product of k independent univariate Gaussians). Geometrically, this variational distribution can only account for axis-aligned elliptical densities. It is thus rather limited in its modelling capabilities. Still, because it uses a neural network under the hood, it is very expressive. \n",

Your job is to combine them into one loss. In mxnet this can be done using the [Group symbol](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/symbol/symbol.html#mxnet.symbol.Group).
